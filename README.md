# tictac

An interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game with a simple, yet effective AI engine.

This repo came into being as the result of my talk at ChennaiPy.

## Testing

```
python tests.py
```

## Running

The following command:

```
python tictac.py
```

opens up a command line wherein you can play using the following command:

```
play <cell>
```

The cell positions are as follows:

```
 0 | 1 | 2
-----------
 3 | 4 | 5
-----------
 6 | 7 | 8
```
